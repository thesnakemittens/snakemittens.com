The user currently going by the alias "snakemittens" was once told that they would become a half-decent sysadmin some day.

Has this day come?  Who knows.  It has been a few years since they were told this, and in the intervening time, they've figured out:

* Linux systems administration (RHEL and CentOS, mostly)
* Windows systems administration
* Mac systems administration
* Automating systems deployment with Ansible, Puppet, and Salt
* Deployment and administration of load-balanced web farms, failover clustered custom applications, containers, and weird things like that
* Data analysis platform setup and administration (Hadoop, Jupyter, Zeppelin, SSRS, PowerBI...)
* Atlassian product administration and support (primarily Confluence and JIRA)
* Team chat application administration (Mattermost, anyone?)
* Assorted web development in whatever language is needed
* Networking is fine and all, but they prefer managing servers
* Documentation is important! (And they're good at it!)

This probably wasn't the path that was expected when the comment was said, but that's how it turned out.

snakemittens has developed a strange fondness for and proficiency at rescuing old, creaky applications from older, creakier servers and restoring them to modern infrastructure. This has led to debugging and converting a suprising amount of ancient Perl code. Coincidentally, snakemittens is no longer fond of Perl.
